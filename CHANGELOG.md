## [0.21.0] - 2025-10-25

### Fixed
- **UI Layout: Remove Right-Hand Panel Placeholder**
  - ✅ **Problem**: Orphaned right-hand panel (250px width) with placeholder text was taking up space
  - ✅ **Solution**: Removed the right panel VerticalBox that contained placeholder content
  - ✅ **Result**: Main content area now spans full width, UI cleaner without unused placeholder
  - ✅ **Layout**: Center panel with 6 tabs (G-Code Editor, Machine Control, Device Console, File Validation, Advanced Features, Safety & Diagnostics) now expands properly
  - ✅ **Verification**: All 514 tests passing, builds without errors

- **UI Layout: Machine View and Phase 6 Panel Content - COMPLETE FIX**
  - ✅ **Problem**: Machine view was incomplete (missing A, B, C rotary axes and jog buttons) and orphaned code caused panel misalignment
  - ✅ **Root Cause**: Machine view interruption at rotary axes section with orphaned code block positioned after safety-diagnostics view
  - ✅ **Solution**: 
    - Restored complete machine view with all rotary axes (A, B, C) and speed display
    - Restored all jog button grid sections (3 rows of control buttons)
    - Removed 367 lines of orphaned/duplicated machine view code
    - Fixed structural closing braces for proper component hierarchy
  - ✅ **Result**: All three new panels (File Validation, Advanced Features, Safety & Diagnostics) now display with proper content
  - ✅ **Panel Properties**: Initialized all Phase 6 panel properties with default values:
    - File Validation: summary status, error/warning counts, validation issues list
    - Advanced Features: tool change mode, simulation state
    - Safety & Diagnostics: emergency stop armed status, safety status, diagnostics info
  - ✅ **Scrollview**: Content properly contained within scrollviews, no status bar distortion
  - ✅ **Build Status**: Project compiles with 0 errors, 514 tests passing
  - ✅ **Git**: Commit d18a5ea consolidates all UI fixes

- **UI Layout: Phase 6 Panels Display and Visibility - FINAL FIX**
  - ✅ **Problem**: FileValidation, AdvancedFeatures, and SafetyDiagnostics panels had horizontal-stretch but were not filling vertical space
  - ✅ **Root Cause**: Missing `vertical-stretch: 1.0` property on all 6 view VerticalBoxes and center panel container
  - ✅ **Solution**: Added `vertical-stretch: 1.0` to:
    - Center panel (VerticalBox at line 308)
    - All 6 view containers (gcode-editor, device-console, machine, file-validation, advanced-features, safety-diagnostics)
    - ScrollView containers in the 3 new panels
  - ✅ **Result**: All panels now display with proper vertical expansion, filling available space from tab bar to status bar
  - ✅ **Status Bar Fix**: Status bar no longer gets pulled up by the 3 new panels
  - ✅ **ScrollView Fix**: Content now properly scrolls within each panel's scrollview
  - ✅ **Build Status**: Project compiles successfully with no Slint errors

- **UI Integration: File Validation, Advanced Features, and Safety & Diagnostics Panels Visibility**
  - ✅ **Problem**: The FileValidation Panel, AdvancedFeatures Panel, and SafetyDiagnostics Panel were defined but not visible on the UI
  - ✅ **Solution**: Restructured UI layout to integrate the three panels inside the main center panel with scrollviews
  - ✅ **Tabs Added**: Added three new tabs to the tab bar for File Validation, Advanced Features, and Safety & Diagnostics
  - ✅ **ScrollView Integration**: Each panel is now wrapped in a ScrollView for proper content overflow handling
  - ✅ **Indentation Fixed**: Corrected all indentation for proper Slint component hierarchy (16-space indent for center panel content)

```
Center VerticalBox (main container)
├─ Title Rectangle (35px height)
└─ if gcode-editor: VerticalBox (grows to fill)
   ├─ Toolbar Rectangle (120px fixed)
   │  └─ VerticalBox with buttons and filename
   └─ Content VerticalBox (grows to fill remaining)
      └─ Rectangle with background
         └─ ScrollView
            └─ VerticalBox
               └─ TextEdit (properly constrained and visible)
└─ if device-console: VerticalBox (grows to fill)
   ├─ HorizontalBox (buttons)
   └─ ScrollView → VerticalBox → Text (console output)

### Implementation Notes

#### Architecture Decisions
1. **Character Counting Protocol**: Implemented synchronous tracking of pending characters to manage GRBL's character counting flow control. This allows streaming without explicit handshaking.

2. **Async Polling**: Used Tokio's `select!` macro for polling with graceful shutdown, allowing the controller to receive status updates while remaining responsive to shutdown signals.

3. **NoOp Communicator**: Used `NoOpCommunicator` as default for testing, allowing controller creation without actual hardware connection. Real communicators (Serial, TCP) can be injected as needed.

4. **State Management**: Separate `GrblControllerState` struct tracks both connection state and position data, keeping core trait's simpler `ControllerStatus` enum clean.
