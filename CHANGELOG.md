### Implementation Notes

#### Architecture Decisions
1. **Character Counting Protocol**: Implemented synchronous tracking of pending characters to manage GRBL's character counting flow control. This allows streaming without explicit handshaking.

2. **Async Polling**: Used Tokio's `select!` macro for polling with graceful shutdown, allowing the controller to receive status updates while remaining responsive to shutdown signals.

3. **NoOp Communicator**: Used `NoOpCommunicator` as default for testing, allowing controller creation without actual hardware connection. Real communicators (Serial, TCP) can be injected as needed.

4. **State Management**: Separate `GrblControllerState` struct tracks both connection state and position data, keeping core trait's simpler `ControllerStatus` enum clean.
