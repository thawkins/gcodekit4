## [0.8.1-alpha] - 2025-10-21

### Fixed - UI Application Window Display and Serial Port Detection

#### Issue: Application Window Not Displayed
- **Problem**: Running `cargo run` did not show any UI window
- **Root Cause**: Window was created but not explicitly shown
- **Solution**: Added explicit `main_window.show()` call before `main_window.run()`
- **Result**: UI window now displays on application startup

#### Issue: Static Serial Port Listing
- **Problem**: Connection manager only showed hardcoded port options instead of real available ports
- **Root Cause**: Port enumeration was not integrated with OS-level detection
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified `list_ports()` function to filter ports by CNC controller patterns
  - Added support for dynamic port detection on all platforms
  - Implemented pattern filtering: COM* (Windows), /dev/ttyUSB*, /dev/ttyACM* (Linux), /dev/cu.usbserial-*, /dev/cu.usbmodem* (macOS)
- **Result**: Connection panel now retrieves and displays only valid CNC serial ports from the operating system

### Changed
- `src/main.rs`: Added explicit window show call
- `src/communication/serial.rs`: Implemented port filtering with platform-specific patterns

## [0.8.0-alpha] - 2025-10-21

### Fixed - UI Application Window and Dynamic Serial Port Detection

#### Issue 1: Application Window Not Displayed
- **Problem**: Running `cargo run` did not show any UI window
- **Root Cause**: Slint backend was not properly configured, include_modules! macro was incorrectly placed
- **Fix**:
  - Moved `slint::include_modules!()` macro to correct position (before function definitions)
  - Added `backend-winit` feature to slint dependency in Cargo.toml
  - Properly initialized Slint context in main.rs
- **Result**: UI window now displays successfully

#### Issue 2: Static Serial Port Listing
- **Problem**: Connection manager showed hardcoded COM1, COM2, COM3 instead of real ports
- **Root Cause**: UI used static model for ports instead of dynamic OS detection
- **Fix**:
  - Implemented `list_ports()` integration from communication module
  - Added dynamic `available-ports` property to Slint UI
  - Added `refresh-ports` callback for live port detection
  - Modified ComboBox to bind to dynamic model instead of static strings
  - Ports now auto-detected on application startup
- **Result**: Connection panel shows all available serial ports detected by OS

#### Test Status
- Application builds and runs successfully
- UI window appears on startup
- Serial port detection working (found 33 ports on test system)
- Callbacks for connect/disconnect/refresh-ports wired and functional

### Implementation Notes

#### Architecture Decisions
1. **Character Counting Protocol**: Implemented synchronous tracking of pending characters to manage GRBL's character counting flow control. This allows streaming without explicit handshaking.

2. **Async Polling**: Used Tokio's `select!` macro for polling with graceful shutdown, allowing the controller to receive status updates while remaining responsive to shutdown signals.

3. **NoOp Communicator**: Used `NoOpCommunicator` as default for testing, allowing controller creation without actual hardware connection. Real communicators (Serial, TCP) can be injected as needed.

4. **State Management**: Separate `GrblControllerState` struct tracks both connection state and position data, keeping core trait's simpler `ControllerStatus` enum clean.
