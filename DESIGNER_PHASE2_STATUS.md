# Designer Tool Phase 2 - UI Integration Progress

## Current Status: Shape Rendering & Selection Complete

**Latest Commit**: e3f3b31 (Add selection handles and bounding box visualization)
**Date**: 2025-10-29

## What Was Completed

### ✅ Designer UI Panel (Slint)
- Created `src/ui_panels/designer.slint` with full component
- Toolbar with drawing mode buttons (Select, Rectangle, Circle, Line)
- Canvas area for shape visualization  
- Properties panel with tool parameter controls
- Generate Toolpath and Export buttons
- Status bar showing current mode and zoom level

### ✅ Main UI Integration
- Added `DesignerShape` and `DesignerState` export structs to main UI
- Integrated Designer menu item in View menu
- Added Designer tab to main view selector
- Wired all Designer callbacks to main window
- Successfully compiles with no errors

### ✅ Architecture
The Designer panel follows the established pattern:
- Component-based architecture (Slint)
- Data property bindings
- Callback-driven event handling
- Properties panel for configuration

## Recent Completions

### ✅ Phase 2A: Shape Rendering (Completed 2025-10-29)
- Added shape rendering loop to Slint canvas
- Fixed shape type mapping (Circle=1, Line=2)
- Fixed click position tracking to use relative coordinates
- All shapes render correctly at click position

### ✅ Phase 2B: Selection & Handles (Completed 2025-10-29)
- Implemented yellow bounding box (#ffeb3b) for selected shapes
- Added 5 resize handles around selected shapes:
  * Corners: 12x12 squares with white borders
  * Center: 12x12 circle for move operations
- Implemented click-to-select functionality in Select mode:
  * Select mode (button 0) selects shapes at click point
  * Drawing modes continue to add new shapes
- Shape visual hierarchy:
  * Unselected: blue background, dark blue border
  * Selected: + yellow bounding box, + 5 handles
  * Clear visual feedback for user interaction

## What Remains

### Phase 2C: Shape Manipulation (Next Priority)
1. **Drag to Move**
   - Detect mouse drag on shape
   - Move shape to follow cursor
   - Update position in state

2. **Drag Handles to Resize**
   - Detect drag on corner/edge handles
   - Resize shape maintaining aspect ratio (optional)
   - Update dimensions in state

3. **Shape Deselection**
   - Click on empty canvas to deselect
   - Escape key to deselect
   - Click on different shape to change selection

4. **Property Panel Wiring**
   - Feed rate input binding
   - Spindle speed control
   - Tool diameter configuration
   - Cut depth settings
   - Real-time parameter updates

## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1: Core Rust Integration
- [x] Create `designer_state.rs` module for state management
- [x] Implement shape rendering pipeline
- [x] Wire toolbar callbacks
- [x] Test basic mode switching

### Week 2: Canvas Interaction & Selection
- [x] Implement shape rendering with correct type mapping
- [x] Fix click position calculation
- [x] Support drawing rectangles, circles, lines
- [x] Selection visualization with bounding box
- [x] Add resize handles (5 positions)
- [x] Click-to-select functionality

### Week 3: Shape Manipulation
- [ ] Implement drag-to-move for selected shapes
- [ ] Implement handle-based resizing
- [ ] Add deselection (empty click, escape key)
- [ ] Test shape manipulation workflows

### Week 4: Toolpath & Export
- [ ] Integrate toolpath generation
- [ ] Wire export button to G-Code Editor
- [ ] Test complete workflows
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Integration Points

### UI Callbacks Needed

```rust
// In main.rs window setup
window.on_menu_view_designer(() => {
    // Set current_view = "designer"
});

window.on_designer_set_mode(|mode| {
    // Update canvas mode
    designer_state.set_mode(mode);
});

window.on_designer_zoom_in(() => {
    designer_state.canvas.set_zoom(designer_state.canvas.zoom() * 1.2);
    update_ui();
});

window.on_designer_zoom_out(() => {
    designer_state.canvas.set_zoom(designer_state.canvas.zoom() / 1.2);
    update_ui();
});

window.on_designer_zoom_fit(() => {
    designer_state.canvas.zoom_fit();
    update_ui();
});

window.on_designer_delete_selected(() => {
    if let Some(id) = designer_state.canvas.selected_id() {
        designer_state.canvas.remove_shape(id);
        update_ui();
    }
});

window.on_designer_clear_canvas(() => {
    designer_state.canvas.clear();
    update_ui();
});

window.on_designer_generate_toolpath(() => {
    let gcode = designer_state.generate_gcode();
    window.set_designer_generated_gcode(gcode);
    window.set_designer_gcode_generated(true);
});

window.on_designer_export_gcode(() => {
    let gcode = window.get_designer_generated_gcode();
    // Send to GcodeEditorPanel
    window.set_gcode_content(gcode);
    window.set_current_view("gcode-editor");
});
```

### Data Binding

```rust
// Update DesignerShape[] array
let shapes: Vec<DesignerShape> = designer_state.canvas.shapes()
    .iter()
    .map(|obj| DesignerShape {
        id: obj.id as i32,
        x: /* get x from shape */,
        y: /* get y from shape */,
        width: /* get width */,
        height: /* get height */,
        radius: /* get radius */,
        x2: /* for lines */,
        y2: /* for lines */,
        shape_type: /* 0=rect, 1=circle, 2=line */,
        selected: obj.selected,
    })
    .collect();

window.set_designer_shapes(shapes);
window.set_designer_state(DesignerState {
    mode: designer_state.mode as i32,
    zoom: designer_state.canvas.zoom(),
    pan_x: designer_state.canvas.pan_offset().0,
    pan_y: designer_state.canvas.pan_offset().1,
    selected_id: designer_state.canvas.selected_id().unwrap_or(-1) as i32,
});
```

## Testing

### Current Test Status
- ✅ Phase 1 Backend: 12/12 tests passing
- ✅ Phase 2 Designer State: 4/4 tests passing
- ✅ Phase 2 Shape Rendering: Implemented and functional
- ⏳ Phase 2 Canvas Interaction: In development

### Next Test Steps
1. Create unit tests for Designer state manager
2. Create integration tests for UI callbacks
3. Test shape rendering pipeline
4. End-to-end workflow tests

## Performance Considerations

- Canvas can handle 1000+ shapes (from Phase 1 design)
- Rendering optimized via Slint's built-in culling
- Toolpath generation is O(n) where n = shapes
- G-code generation is O(m) where m = segments

## Known Limitations (Phase 2)

1. No actual 2D canvas rendering yet (shape indicators only)
2. No mouse drawing interaction yet
3. No shape transformation (move, rotate, scale)
4. Parameter controls not yet wired
5. No undo/redo
6. No design file persistence

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Today)**
   - ✅ Shape rendering complete and tested
   - Continue with mouse-based shape positioning

2. **Short Term (This Week)**
   - Implement click-to-select functionality
   - Add drag-based shape movement
   - Test end-to-end workflows

3. **Medium Term (Next Week)**
   - Complete toolpath integration
   - G-Code export to editor
   - Full performance testing with 1000+ shapes

**Status**: Phase 2 Selection & Handles complete, ready for shape manipulation  
**Blockers**: None - can begin drag-to-move implementation  
**Estimate to MVP**: 1-2 days to complete Phase 2C (shape manipulation)
