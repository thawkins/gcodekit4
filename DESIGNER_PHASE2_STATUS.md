# Designer Tool Phase 2 - UI Integration Progress

## Current Status: Phase 2C Shape Manipulation Complete

**Latest Commit**: 2b1f9ed (Phase 2C: Implement shape manipulation)
**Date**: 2025-10-29

## What Was Completed

### ✅ Designer UI Panel (Slint)
- Created `src/ui_panels/designer.slint` with full component
- Toolbar with drawing mode buttons (Select, Rectangle, Circle, Line)
- Canvas area for shape visualization  
- Properties panel with tool parameter controls
- Generate Toolpath and Export buttons
- Status bar showing current mode and zoom level

### ✅ Main UI Integration
- Added `DesignerShape` and `DesignerState` export structs to main UI
- Integrated Designer menu item in View menu
- Added Designer tab to main view selector
- Wired all Designer callbacks to main window
- Successfully compiles with no errors

### ✅ Architecture
The Designer panel follows the established pattern:
- Component-based architecture (Slint)
- Data property bindings
- Callback-driven event handling
- Properties panel for configuration

## Recent Completions

### ✅ Phase 2A: Shape Rendering (Completed 2025-10-29)
- Added shape rendering loop to Slint canvas
- Fixed shape type mapping (Circle=1, Line=2)
- Fixed click position tracking to use relative coordinates
- All shapes render correctly at click position

### ✅ Phase 2B: Selection & Handles (Completed 2025-10-29)
- Implemented yellow bounding box (#ffeb3b) for selected shapes
- Added 5 resize handles around selected shapes:
  * Corners: 12x12 squares with white borders
  * Center: 12x12 circle for move operations
- Implemented click-to-select functionality in Select mode:
  * Select mode (button 0) selects shapes at click point
  * Drawing modes continue to add new shapes
- Shape visual hierarchy:
  * Unselected: blue background, dark blue border
  * Selected: + yellow bounding box, + 5 handles
  * Clear visual feedback for user interaction

## What Remains

### ✅ Phase 2C: Shape Manipulation (Completed 2025-10-29)
- Implemented move_selected(dx, dy) for smooth shape translation
- Implemented resize_selected(handle, dx, dy) with 5 handle points
  * Corner handles (4): Resize from opposite corner
  * Center handle: Acts as move operation
  * Aspect ratio maintained for circles
- Added TouchArea drag handlers to selected shapes:
  * Shape body: grab cursor, drag-to-move
  * Each handle: appropriate resize cursor, drag-to-resize
- Real-time visual feedback during manipulation
- All operations update UI immediately via update_designer_ui()
- Callback pipeline: Slint UI → main.rs → DesignerState → Canvas

## What Remains

### Phase 2D: Deselection & Polish (Final)
1. **Click empty canvas to deselect**
   - Track if click is on empty area
   - Clear selected_id if not on shape

2. **Keyboard shortcuts**
   - Escape key to deselect
   - Delete key to remove selected
   - Ctrl+A to select all (optional)

3. **Edge cases & refinement**
   - Prevent negative dimensions during resize
   - Minimum size constraints for shapes
   - Smooth interaction feedback

## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1: Core Rust Integration
- [x] Create `designer_state.rs` module for state management
- [x] Implement shape rendering pipeline
- [x] Wire toolbar callbacks
- [x] Test basic mode switching

### Week 2: Canvas Interaction & Selection
- [x] Implement shape rendering with correct type mapping
- [x] Fix click position calculation
- [x] Support drawing rectangles, circles, lines
- [x] Selection visualization with bounding box
- [x] Add resize handles (5 positions)
- [x] Click-to-select functionality

### Week 3: Shape Manipulation
- [x] Implement drag-to-move for selected shapes
- [x] Implement handle-based resizing
- [x] Add proper cursor feedback
- [x] Real-time UI updates

### Week 4: Deselection & Export
- [ ] Implement deselection (empty click, escape key)
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Polish edge cases
- [ ] Integrate toolpath generation
- [ ] Wire export button to G-Code Editor

## Integration Points

### UI Callbacks Needed

```rust
// In main.rs window setup
window.on_menu_view_designer(() => {
    // Set current_view = "designer"
});

window.on_designer_set_mode(|mode| {
    // Update canvas mode
    designer_state.set_mode(mode);
});

window.on_designer_zoom_in(() => {
    designer_state.canvas.set_zoom(designer_state.canvas.zoom() * 1.2);
    update_ui();
});

window.on_designer_zoom_out(() => {
    designer_state.canvas.set_zoom(designer_state.canvas.zoom() / 1.2);
    update_ui();
});

window.on_designer_zoom_fit(() => {
    designer_state.canvas.zoom_fit();
    update_ui();
});

window.on_designer_delete_selected(() => {
    if let Some(id) = designer_state.canvas.selected_id() {
        designer_state.canvas.remove_shape(id);
        update_ui();
    }
});

window.on_designer_clear_canvas(() => {
    designer_state.canvas.clear();
    update_ui();
});

window.on_designer_generate_toolpath(() => {
    let gcode = designer_state.generate_gcode();
    window.set_designer_generated_gcode(gcode);
    window.set_designer_gcode_generated(true);
});

window.on_designer_export_gcode(() => {
    let gcode = window.get_designer_generated_gcode();
    // Send to GcodeEditorPanel
    window.set_gcode_content(gcode);
    window.set_current_view("gcode-editor");
});
```

### Data Binding

```rust
// Update DesignerShape[] array
let shapes: Vec<DesignerShape> = designer_state.canvas.shapes()
    .iter()
    .map(|obj| DesignerShape {
        id: obj.id as i32,
        x: /* get x from shape */,
        y: /* get y from shape */,
        width: /* get width */,
        height: /* get height */,
        radius: /* get radius */,
        x2: /* for lines */,
        y2: /* for lines */,
        shape_type: /* 0=rect, 1=circle, 2=line */,
        selected: obj.selected,
    })
    .collect();

window.set_designer_shapes(shapes);
window.set_designer_state(DesignerState {
    mode: designer_state.mode as i32,
    zoom: designer_state.canvas.zoom(),
    pan_x: designer_state.canvas.pan_offset().0,
    pan_y: designer_state.canvas.pan_offset().1,
    selected_id: designer_state.canvas.selected_id().unwrap_or(-1) as i32,
});
```

## Testing

### Current Test Status
- ✅ Phase 1 Backend: 12/12 tests passing
- ✅ Phase 2 Designer State: 4/4 tests passing
- ✅ Phase 2 Shape Rendering: Implemented and functional
- ⏳ Phase 2 Canvas Interaction: In development

### Next Test Steps
1. Create unit tests for Designer state manager
2. Create integration tests for UI callbacks
3. Test shape rendering pipeline
4. End-to-end workflow tests

## Performance Considerations

- Canvas can handle 1000+ shapes (from Phase 1 design)
- Rendering optimized via Slint's built-in culling
- Toolpath generation is O(n) where n = shapes
- G-code generation is O(m) where m = segments

## Known Limitations (Phase 2)

1. No actual 2D canvas rendering yet (shape indicators only)
2. No mouse drawing interaction yet
3. No shape transformation (move, rotate, scale)
4. Parameter controls not yet wired
5. No undo/redo
6. No design file persistence

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Today)**
   - ✅ Shape rendering complete and tested
   - Continue with mouse-based shape positioning

2. **Short Term (This Week)**
   - Implement click-to-select functionality
   - Add drag-based shape movement
   - Test end-to-end workflows

3. **Medium Term (Next Week)**
   - Complete toolpath integration
   - G-Code export to editor
   - Full performance testing with 1000+ shapes
