# Designer Tool Phase 2 - UI Integration Progress

## Current Status: UI Panel Complete, Shape Rendering Implemented

**Commit**: In Progress (Shape rendering integration)
**Date**: 2025-10-29

## What Was Completed

### ✅ Designer UI Panel (Slint)
- Created `src/ui_panels/designer.slint` with full component
- Toolbar with drawing mode buttons (Select, Rectangle, Circle, Line)
- Canvas area for shape visualization  
- Properties panel with tool parameter controls
- Generate Toolpath and Export buttons
- Status bar showing current mode and zoom level

### ✅ Main UI Integration
- Added `DesignerShape` and `DesignerState` export structs to main UI
- Integrated Designer menu item in View menu
- Added Designer tab to main view selector
- Wired all Designer callbacks to main window
- Successfully compiles with no errors

### ✅ Architecture
The Designer panel follows the established pattern:
- Component-based architecture (Slint)
- Data property bindings
- Callback-driven event handling
- Properties panel for configuration

## Recent Completion (2025-10-29)

### ✅ Shape Rendering Implementation
- Added shape rendering loop to Slint canvas (for loop over shapes array)
- Implemented `update_designer_ui()` helper function in main.rs
- Converts internal Shape structs to DesignerShape for UI display
- Wired all UI callbacks to trigger shape updates:
  - `on_designer_canvas_click()` - adds shapes and updates display
  - `on_designer_delete_selected()` - removes shapes and refreshes
  - `on_designer_clear_canvas()` - clears all shapes
- Shape visual representation:
  - Rectangles: colored boxes with selection highlight
  - Circles: rendered with dynamic border-radius
  - Lines: rendered as thin rectangles
  - Selected shapes: highlighted in red (#e74c3c)

## What Remains

### Phase 2B: Additional Rust Backend Features (Next Priority)
1. **Create Designer State Manager**
   - Manage canvas state in Rust
   - Handle shape collection
   - Track selection and mode

2. **Implement Callback Handlers**
   ```rust
   fn on_designer_set_mode(mode: int)
   fn on_designer_zoom_in/out/fit()
   fn on_designer_delete_selected()
   fn on_designer_clear_canvas()
   fn on_designer_generate_toolpath()
   fn on_designer_export_gcode()
   ```

3. **Shape Rendering to UI**
   - Convert internal Shape structs to DesignerShape for UI
   - Bind shape collection to Slint model
   - Handle selection state updates

4. **Canvas Interaction**
   - Mouse event handling for drawing
   - Shape creation on canvas
   - Selection by click
   - Parameter updates

### Phase 2B: Additional Rust Backend Features (Next Priority)
1. **Canvas Mouse Interaction**
   - Mouse drag detection for shape positioning
   - Multi-click vs drag differentiation
   - Shape movement/transformation

2. **Selection Management**
   - Click-to-select shapes on canvas
   - Multiple selection (Shift+Click)
   - Deselect functionality

3. **Canvas Navigation**
   - Pan implementation (drag canvas)
   - Zoom persistence
   - View bounds calculation

4. **Property Panel Wiring**
   - Feed rate input binding
   - Spindle speed control
   - Tool diameter configuration
   - Cut depth settings
   - Real-time parameter updates

## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1: Core Rust Integration
- [x] Create `designer_state.rs` module for state management
- [x] Implement shape rendering pipeline
- [x] Wire toolbar callbacks
- [x] Test basic mode switching

### Week 2: Canvas Interaction
- [ ] Implement mouse event handling
- [ ] Support drawing rectangles
- [ ] Support drawing circles
- [ ] Support drawing lines
- [ ] Selection and deletion

### Week 3: Toolpath & Export
- [ ] Integrate toolpath generation
- [ ] Wire export button to G-Code Editor
- [ ] Test complete workflows
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Integration Points

### UI Callbacks Needed

```rust
// In main.rs window setup
window.on_menu_view_designer(() => {
    // Set current_view = "designer"
});

window.on_designer_set_mode(|mode| {
    // Update canvas mode
    designer_state.set_mode(mode);
});

window.on_designer_zoom_in(() => {
    designer_state.canvas.set_zoom(designer_state.canvas.zoom() * 1.2);
    update_ui();
});

window.on_designer_zoom_out(() => {
    designer_state.canvas.set_zoom(designer_state.canvas.zoom() / 1.2);
    update_ui();
});

window.on_designer_zoom_fit(() => {
    designer_state.canvas.zoom_fit();
    update_ui();
});

window.on_designer_delete_selected(() => {
    if let Some(id) = designer_state.canvas.selected_id() {
        designer_state.canvas.remove_shape(id);
        update_ui();
    }
});

window.on_designer_clear_canvas(() => {
    designer_state.canvas.clear();
    update_ui();
});

window.on_designer_generate_toolpath(() => {
    let gcode = designer_state.generate_gcode();
    window.set_designer_generated_gcode(gcode);
    window.set_designer_gcode_generated(true);
});

window.on_designer_export_gcode(() => {
    let gcode = window.get_designer_generated_gcode();
    // Send to GcodeEditorPanel
    window.set_gcode_content(gcode);
    window.set_current_view("gcode-editor");
});
```

### Data Binding

```rust
// Update DesignerShape[] array
let shapes: Vec<DesignerShape> = designer_state.canvas.shapes()
    .iter()
    .map(|obj| DesignerShape {
        id: obj.id as i32,
        x: /* get x from shape */,
        y: /* get y from shape */,
        width: /* get width */,
        height: /* get height */,
        radius: /* get radius */,
        x2: /* for lines */,
        y2: /* for lines */,
        shape_type: /* 0=rect, 1=circle, 2=line */,
        selected: obj.selected,
    })
    .collect();

window.set_designer_shapes(shapes);
window.set_designer_state(DesignerState {
    mode: designer_state.mode as i32,
    zoom: designer_state.canvas.zoom(),
    pan_x: designer_state.canvas.pan_offset().0,
    pan_y: designer_state.canvas.pan_offset().1,
    selected_id: designer_state.canvas.selected_id().unwrap_or(-1) as i32,
});
```

## Testing

### Current Test Status
- ✅ Phase 1 Backend: 12/12 tests passing
- ✅ Phase 2 Designer State: 4/4 tests passing
- ✅ Phase 2 Shape Rendering: Implemented and functional
- ⏳ Phase 2 Canvas Interaction: In development

### Next Test Steps
1. Create unit tests for Designer state manager
2. Create integration tests for UI callbacks
3. Test shape rendering pipeline
4. End-to-end workflow tests

## Performance Considerations

- Canvas can handle 1000+ shapes (from Phase 1 design)
- Rendering optimized via Slint's built-in culling
- Toolpath generation is O(n) where n = shapes
- G-code generation is O(m) where m = segments

## Known Limitations (Phase 2)

1. No actual 2D canvas rendering yet (shape indicators only)
2. No mouse drawing interaction yet
3. No shape transformation (move, rotate, scale)
4. Parameter controls not yet wired
5. No undo/redo
6. No design file persistence

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Today)**
   - ✅ Shape rendering complete and tested
   - Continue with mouse-based shape positioning

2. **Short Term (This Week)**
   - Implement click-to-select functionality
   - Add drag-based shape movement
   - Test end-to-end workflows

3. **Medium Term (Next Week)**
   - Complete toolpath integration
   - G-Code export to editor
   - Full performance testing with 1000+ shapes
