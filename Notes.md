2. add a closed property to polyline( path) objects to close the start to the end if they are not colocated. 
3. Add the ability to convert a polyline (path) object to a rectangle based on its bounding box, support multiple selected shapes. this provides a simple way of converting polyline slots into a rectangle that can be set to a slot.
