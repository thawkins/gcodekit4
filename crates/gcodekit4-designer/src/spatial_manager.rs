/// Manages the spatial index for efficient shape queries.
///
/// `SpatialManager` wraps the `SpatialIndex` and provides a clean interface for:
/// - Inserting shapes into the spatial index
/// - Removing shapes from the spatial index
/// - Updating shape positions in the index
/// - Querying shapes by point or bounding box
///
/// # Purpose
///
/// The spatial index enables O(log n) queries for:
/// - "What shapes are at this point?" (for selection)
/// - "What shapes intersect this rectangle?" (for drag-select)
///
/// Without spatial indexing, these queries would be O(n), checking every shape.
///
/// # Design
///
/// This manager encapsulates the `SpatialIndex` to provide a simpler API
/// and hide implementation details from the rest of the codebase.
