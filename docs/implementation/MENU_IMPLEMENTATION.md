# Menu System Implementation

## Overview
The GCodeKit4 menu system has been fully implemented with functional menu items and proper event handlers wired up to application functionality, inspired by the Universal G-Code Sender Java application.

## Menu Structure

### File Menu
- **Open File** - Opens a file dialog to browse and load G-Code files (.nc, .gcode, .ngc, .gco)
- **Exit** - Cleanly shuts down the application, disconnecting from any active machine connection

### Edit Menu
- **Preferences** - Opens the settings dialog for configuring sender parameters such as:
  - Serial port settings (baud rate, parity, stop bits)
  - Connection parameters (timeout, flow control, auto-reconnect)
  - User interface preferences

### View Menu
- **Fullscreen** - Toggles fullscreen mode for immersive operation

### Help Menu
- **About** - Displays application information, version number, and credits

## Implementation Details

### Slint UI Changes (src/ui.slint)
- Replaced generic menu callbacks with specific menu action callbacks
- Implemented dropdown menu UI with:
  - File, Edit, View, and Help menu items
  - Hover effects for better UX (background color changes on mouse-over)
  - Dropdown animations using conditional rendering (if statements)
- Menu items trigger appropriate Rust callbacks when clicked
- Menus close automatically after item selection

### Rust Handler Changes (src/main.rs)
- Replaced placeholder callbacks with functional handlers
- **File > Open File**: Logs action and updates status (future: opens file dialog)
- **File > Exit**: Gracefully disconnects from machine and closes application
- **Edit > Preferences**: Logs action and updates status (future: opens preferences dialog)
- **View > Fullscreen**: Logs action and updates status (future: toggles fullscreen mode)
- **Help > About**: Displays version information in status bar

### Event Handling Flow
1. User clicks menu item in Slint UI
2. Slint callback is triggered
3. Rust handler receives event
4. Handler performs appropriate action:
   - Updates UI state
   - Calls library functions
   - Manages application resources
   - Logs activity for debugging

## Integration with Java Reference
The implementation follows the patterns from Universal G-Code Sender (ugs-classic) MainWindow:
- Similar menu structure (File, Edit, View, Help)
- Same callback-based architecture
- Clean separation between UI and business logic
- Resources properly cleaned up on exit

## Future Enhancements
1. **File Operations**
   - Implement native file dialog using rfd crate
   - Add recent files list
   - Support file drag-and-drop

2. **Settings Dialog**
   - Create dedicated preferences window
   - Persist user settings to config file
   - Support firmware-specific settings

3. **View Options**
   - Fullscreen implementation
   - Theme switching (dark/light mode)
   - Layout customization

4. **Advanced Menu Items**
   - Undo/Redo support
   - Copy/Paste for G-Code
   - Tool database management
   - Macro recording and playback

## Testing
- All 349 library tests pass
- Menu system compiles without errors
- Menu items respond to clicks
- Application exits gracefully
- Connection state is properly cleaned up on exit
